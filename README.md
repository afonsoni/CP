# CP
Parallel Computing (Computação Paralela)

## Phase 1
This assignment phase aimed to explore optimisation techniques applied to a (single threaded) program, using tools for code analysis/profiling and to improve and evaluate its final performance (execution time).

The program to analyse and optimise is part of a simple molecular dynamics’ simulation code applied to atoms of argon gas (original code version in FoleyLab/MolecularDynamics: Simple Molecular Dynamics).

Grade: 12.50/20.00

## Phase 2
This assignment phase aimed to explore shared memory parallelism (OpenMP-based) to improve the overall execution time.

It was requested the improvement of the computation time of the code developed in phase 1, exploring shared memory parallelism with OpenMP directives.

## Phase 3
This assignment phase aimed to understand how to design and implement an efficient parallel version of the case study, eventually using accelerators (e.g., GPUs), keeping the main goal of reducing the execution time.

In this final assignment there was freedom to select one of three alternative paths to improve the execution of the work submitted in previous phases: i) Correct/improve the OpenMP implementation (this option is limited to a max grade of 13 values); ii) design and implement a new version for accelerators (GPU with CUDA); iii) design and implement a new version for distributed memory (C with MPI).

It was chosen the second option, to design and implement a new version for accelarators, with CUDA.
